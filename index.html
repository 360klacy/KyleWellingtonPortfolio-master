        <strong id="about">About Me</strong><br>I'm originally from Mobile, Alabama and my parents moved my family and I to Hampton, Ga in year 2000. After completing high school in 2008 I attended 
        <strong>Alabama A&M University</strong> and later transferred to <strong>Clark Atlanta University</strong> in 2010 for my undergraduate studies where I majored in Biology and minored in English. While 
        in undergrad I was selected as team captain for both football and baseball teams. Performing duties in football as the <strong>quarterback</strong> and 
        played<strong> right field and pitched</strong> for baseball. Upon graduation, in 2013 I was blessed with a <strong> beautiful daughter</strong> and she changed my life to want to 
        leave a lasting legacy behind for her. After many years in customer service I was ready to embark into the entreprenual realm and have been 
        conducting business all over North America in the <strong> Experential Marketing</strong> capacity as well as the <strong> Waste Management</strong> industry since 2016. After being successful in those
        given fields I felt the need to challenge myself as well as obtain skills that would be beneficial for me personally and business purposes. 
        <strong>DigitalCrafts Coding Boot Camp</strong> was my way of improving myself as well as immerse myself into an ever-learning environment like software engineering.
        I have an obsession with critical thinking, creative innovations, and finding sustainable solutions. With the skills that I have learned
        I am more than confident that I will be of great value to any team and I will search every nook, cranny, or crevice for an answer or soultion.<br> <strong> Finish this day strong!</strong> </p>

            The interactive single player, multiplayer, and free for all game Planet of The Shapes gives users
            and opportunity to register, login, and compete for the top score of the game. This video snippet displays when a 
            shape shooter actually strikes any shape with it's ammunition that shape decreases in size but multiplies 
            by dividing into various smaller shapes. Try it out here at planetoftheshapes.xyz.

              By providing a register screen to the users I was able to create a database that not only  prompts into that users
              portal but also give them access to come back onto the site and keep up with there high scores. I also used a hash method 
              for password security. With this token the user can feel safe while providing there password and for me as the creator I 
              won't have access to such sensitive information.

              The difficulties that I worked hard through while establishing the user database 
              was updating the high scores throughout each log in. The solution I used was posting the high score element to the database after each game play.
              The next accomplished goal was to have a top 10 leaderboard. That information was posted to the dom and the database then filtered the list by the 
              highest integer.

            Web app that utilizes online API'S TAHT allows users to take part in a trivia game. Users can save score for competition against other users.
            Being my first time using API's I decided to present a couple different fetch elements for a more distractive and humorous game play. 
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="wrap">
        <img id="myImg" class="thumbnail" src="clickHandlerMTA.png" width="320" height="228">
            <p>
             The challenge that I worked hard through was actually taking the new array of incorrct and correct answers and shuffling them so that the 
             user could not just know what place the correct answer would be each time. If you see the picture above you can see a simple else/if statement
             helped me achieve this shuffle function for full functionality.
            </p>
        </div>
      <div class="wrap">
        <img id="myImg" class="thumbnail" src="redGreenButtons.png" width="320" height="228">
          <p>
            So now that I had the shuffle of incorrect and correct answers now is the time to get the user notified if there answer is wrong or not. I used the 
            colors red for incorrect and green for correct. This seemed pretty doable at first but ran into a bump in the road as we fetched new data from the API
            and not hard coding which answer was correct each time. Essentially I was able to randomize the buttom arrangement and tag on the correct color of the button.
